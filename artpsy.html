                <p><strong><em>“[I]t was the color of someone buying you an ice cream cone for no reason at all.”</em><br>
                ― (Lemony Snicket, When Did You See Her Last?)</strong></p><br>
                <p>Ice cream can inspire the wonder of colors in an artist’s paint, or just create the individual pleasure of taste, which can lead to a state of happiness.  
                The pleasure of ice cream can stay in the memory from childhood to adulthood, connecting the experiences of an afternoon in the park, or the neighborhood 
                friends gathering together around an ice cream truck on a hot summer night.  Artists have tried to imprint those experiences in a painting, a movie, or even 
                in a comedy routine.  Maybe is a form of archetype in our lives in which taste connects the routinary to the transcendence of happiness, a form of daydreaming 
                becoming reality.  The explanation might be in the brain, in the stomach, in culture, or in the magical world of childhood.  In any case, dare to always explore 
                the possibilities of taste, color, or the opportunity of engaging positively in your own psyche, and run the child in you yelling "ice cream!, ice cream!"... 
                What’s your flavor?</p>

                    <p><em>"Eating ice cream really does make you happy. Scientists have found that a spoonful of the cold stuff lights up the same pleasure centre in the brain as winning money or listening to your favourite music.
                    Neuroscientists at the Institute of Psychiatry in London scanned the brains of people eating vanilla ice cream. They found an immediate effect on parts of the brain known to activate when people enjoy themselves; these include the orbitofrontal cortex, the "processing" area at the front of the brain.
                    The research was carried out by Unilever, using ice cream made by Walls, which it owns. Don Darling of Unilever said: "This is the first time that we've been able to show that ice cream makes you happy. Just one spoonful lights up the happy zones of the brain in clinical trials."
                    The scientists used a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine to watch blood flowing to activated brain areas when people swallowed ice cream."</em> <br>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/apr/29/health.science" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> </p>

                    <p>"In late summer, 1938, Picasso read that the Nazis had burned two Van Gogh paintings to demonstrate their scorn. To demonstrate his, he responded with L'Homme au chapeau de paille (Man with a Straw Hat and Ice Cream Cone), himself  as Van Gogh. Wearing the Dutch artist's straw hat, he  affirmed a beauty outside the realm of convention, with a lurid tongue licking the cone." <br>From <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/anotherbb/author/another-bouncing-ball/2010/12/" target="_blank">Another Bouncing Ball</a></p>

                    <p>There's something about the icecream truck that makes kids lose it.<br>

                    <p>"There's a reason why fatty foods are called comfort foods. They soothe the savage within us.
                    Have you ever wondered why?
                    [In 2011]... a team of researchers at the University of Leuven, Belgium, published images of activity in the brain during times of sadness. Then they looked at how the images changed when a fat solution was introduced into the stomach.
                    The brain images revealed what ice cream lovers have long known: the brain's responses to sadness were significantly reduced when the fatty solution was infused into the stomach. Respondents also reported less hunger and a better mood when the fatty solution was given. The effect was significant in the pharmacological sense: the fatty solution reduced the intensity of sad emotions by almost half--which is about as much as any prescription antidepressant can achieve." <br>From <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-sense/201107/why-ice-cream-chases-the-blues-away" target="_blank">Psychology Today</a></p><br>

                    Ice Cream Man: Huh?<br>
                    Ernie: Hey, Mr. Ice Cream Cone Man, I want a very special ice cream cone, can you make it up for me? Okay, here comes the flavour. Now, I would like one chocolate-strawberry-peach-vanilla-banana-pastachio-peppermint-lemon-orange-butterscotch ice cream cone<br>
                    Ice Cream Man: What did you say?<br>
                    Ernie: I said, I want a chocolate-strawberry-peach-vanilla-banana-pastachio-peppermint-lemon-orange-butterscotch ice cream cone<br>
                    Ice Cream Man: You mean you want a chocolate-strawberry-peach-vanilla-banana-pastachio-peppermint-lemon-orange-butterscotch ice cream cone?<br>
                    Ernie: Yup!<br>
                    Ice Cream Man: Okay, I'll be right back<br>
                    Ernie: Oh boy, I can hardly wait! Hardly wait for my chocolate-strawberry-peach-vanilla-banana-pastachio-peppermint-lemon-orange-butterscotch ice cream cone!<br>
                    Ice Cream Man: Ha! You didn't think I'd remember that you wanted a chocolate-strawberry-peach- vanilla-banana-pastachio-peppermint-lemon-orange-butterscotch cone, did ya? But I did!<br>
                    Ernie: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Listen, you brought me an ice cream cone all right, but you brought me a butterscotch-orange-lemon-peppermint-pastachio-banana-vanilla-peach-strawberry-chocolate cone! And I didn't ask you for that, I asked you for a chocolate-strawberry-peach-vanilla-banana-pastachio-peppermint-lemon-orange-butterscotch cone!<br>
                    Ice Cream Man: You mean ...<br>
                    Ernie: I mean you put the chocolate on the bottom and the butterscotch on the top and I wanted the butterscotch on the bottom and the chocolate on the top! You made my ice cream cone upside down!<br>
                    Ice Cream Man: Come on now, it really doesn't matter if you have a chocolate-strawberry-peach-vanilla-banana-pastachio-peppermint-lemon-orange-butterscotch ice cream cone or a butterscotch-orange-lemon-peppermint-pastachio-banana-vanilla-peach-strawberry-chocolate cone!<br>
                    Ernie: Doesn't matter? Why, of course it matters. It matters very much that you put the top on the bottom and the bottom on the top! Why, what makes you think that it doesn't matter?!<br>
                    Ice Cream Man: All right, I'll tell you what, if you wanted the cone to be a chocolate-strawberry-peach-vanilla-banana-pastachio-peppermint-lemon-orange-butterscotch and I made it instead into a butterscotch-orange-lemon-peppermint-pastachio-banana-vanilla-peach-strawberry-chocolate cone, it's very easy to fix<br>
                    Ernie: Hmm ... well, how is it easy to fix when you put the chocolate on the bottom, down here, and I wanted it on the top, up here?!<br>
                    Ice Cream Man: Simple, just eat the same cone standing on your head!<br>
